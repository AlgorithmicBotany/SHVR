# SHVR

## What is it?

SHVR (Segmentation using Haptics and Volumetric Rendering) is a program designed to segment volumetric dataset by using the haptic device to interact with structures. Automated segmentation processes rely heavily on assumptions about the dataset to set parameters for segmentation. With 1-to-1 mapping of the controller to the 3D virtual space, and force feedback to provide assistance along a region of interest, we aim to encourage interactivity to the segmentation process. This project is developed by Philmo Gu, with the assistance of Andrew Owens, Sonny Chan, and supervision of Dr. Przemyslaw Prusinkiewicz.
